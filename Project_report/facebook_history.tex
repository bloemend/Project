\section{Online Social Networks}\label{sec:first_section}
\paragraph{}
Since Facebook was introduced to the public in 2006, it has grown to be the largest online social network (OSN) in the world. OSNs have a peer-to-peer architecture, and therefore makes it easy for members to initiate communication with whom they want, given that they are also connected to the network. OSNs also enables the possibility for people to easily publish and retrieve information about subjects of interest \cite{DPBook}. The growth of Facebook has made it necessary to introduce new ways to manage privacy and ensure a secure online environment. When it comes to OSNs the privacy embedded in the program/app etc. is not enough to ensure such an environment, due to the interdependent privacy issues. Your privacy is to a large extent affected by the privacy decision of others. In this chapter we are going to look into the history of Facebookâ€™s privacy settings, and map the development from 2006 until today.

Facebook has evolved from being a networking site for students attending Harvard to becoming a global phenomenon. Facebook's user interface has gone through several changes over the years, which has brought both joy and frustration to the users. When these changes have been made, there has also been adjustments to the default privacy settings as well \cite{EvoPriv2}. At the beginning, in 2005, when Facebook first was applied outside of Harvard University, the users personal information was only accessible to a users Facebook friends and to people connected to the same network on Facebook \cite{EvoPriv}.
