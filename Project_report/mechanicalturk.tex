\chapter{Construction of the Survey}
\label{chp:amtsurvey} 

To be able to map to what extent people care and are aware of their Facebook settings, regarding privacy, security and interdependent privacy, we designed and distributed a survey. The survey addressed the different settings available on Facebook, and awareness regarding Facebook applications and knowledge about interdependent privacy. For the design of the survey, we utilized SurveyMonkey which provides web-based survey solutions (see section \ref{sec:sm}). We distributed the survey on two platforms, namely Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) and Facebook. Amazon Mechanical Turk is a Internet marketplace where human intelligence is utilized to perform various tasks \cite{amazonweb}. For more information about Amazon Mechanical Turk, see section \ref{sec:amt}. To reach out to a even larger audience, we posted the survey-link on our Facebook pages. In this chapter we will describe how we designed the survey, how it is structured and how we distributed our survey. We will examine the results with focus on interdependent privacy. 


\paragraph{Constructing the Survey}
There is not much research on the area of interdependent privacy. To be able to bring forward information and contribute to new research, we created a survey. When making the questions, we wanted to create an image of peoples use of Facebook, how they set their settings and how they know and care about their privacy and to what extent their privacy is dependent on other users. We quickly chose to use AMT as a platform for distributing the survey, because we wanted to create an image of the average Facebook user as well as getting a high diversity among the respondents (different countries, age, education etc.). Previous research shows positive results with the use of AMT \cite{expectations,incentivesAmt}. 

\paragraph{}
We started implementing the survey inside the survey template provided by AMT. After some consideration, we found that AMT did fulfil our requirements for design, so we chose to implement the survey using SurveyMonkey instead. When creating the survey, we thought that it would be better to include some extra questions, than to leave some behind. When the survey first got distributed, we were not longer able to edit the questions. We therefore chose to include questions not only regarding privacy and interdependent privacy, but also other aspects of Facebook usage. For example some questions about security settings, usage, personal experience in regard to photos and comment sharing.

\section{Design}
AMT offers a template for creating surveys. This template uses HTML. It is simple, but requires more work from the requester. We found the template to be little user friendly, and it did not give you many design options. Our survey consist of many questions, and some of them had follow-up questions requiring text answers. It was then desirable to have these on two different pages. We did not want the respondents to have their answers affected by the next question. It requires more of the respondent to write a text answer, so to avoid them answering based on the next question we separated the questions onto different pages. For example, we have one question asking whether or not the use of Facebook has lead to any uncomfortable situations. If the user answers "Yes", a follow-up question asking to describe the situation that occurred will appear. If the user answers "No" the follow-up question will be skipped. If the user had seen the follow-up question, he/she may not be bothered to answer yes even though this may have been the truthful answer. We did not find an easy solution to implement this design feature in AMT, so we looked for other options. Even though AMT provides their own "Survey"-template, they also provide a "Survey Link"-template. This means that you can create the survey somewhere else, and just link to it in AMT. We chose the latter, and used SurveyMonkey to create the survey. SurveyMonkey provided us with the tools and features necessary to design our survey as desired. 

\paragraph{Features we used in SurveyMonkey.}
SurveyMonkey offers several features, and has a intuitive user interface. It was easy to implement the questions, and separate them on different pages which was of high value to us. SurveyMonkey offers the ability to customize the appearance (color/theme, layout, etc.) of the survey to a higher extent than AMT. We put in a picture of the university logo, to emphasize the seriousness of the survey, as shown in \fref{fig:frontpage}. SurveyMonkey also offers many different question types (multiple choice, text box, matrix and drop-down menus, etc.), and restrictions on the questions. It was important to have some restrictions especially on the text boxes. Some of the restrictions that we used was to limit the amount of characters in the text boxes, to avoid too long answers. We also made almost all questions mandatory, meaning that the respondents had to answer them before being able to move to the next question. As mentioned we divided the questions onto several different pages. This gives the respondents the impression that the survey is shorter. Each page has a title on top, grouping the different areas the questions consider. A progress bar was added to show in percent how far into the survey the respondent was at any time. This gives a good overview, and the user get a feeling of how much is left. We chose to use these features to avoid overwhelming the respondents with too many questions at a time. 

SurveyMonkey offers a great user interface also when it comes to reviewing the answers. It is possible to see graphs showing the distribution of answers to all of the questions, as well as individual answers. SurveyMonkey also offers a filter and comparing feature, which made the analysis a lot easier, especially when having a large number of respondents. 

\section{How the Survey is Structured} 
The first page seen when taking the survey, is a introduction page that shortly explains what the survey is about, and it's purpose. This page emphasizes the seriousness of the survey. When people see that it is a research survey carried out by master students at an university, we believe people will answer in a serious manner. The front page also includes the requirement for taking the survey, and a short explanation on where to find answers requested in some of the questions. This is shown in \fref{fig:frontpage}. As mentioned before, we have divided the questions into different areas, and we will now go through each area and emphasize and elaborate the questions we consider as most relevant and important.

It gives a short explanation about the purpose of the survey, and what it concerns. It also give some helping guidelines to where to find answers to some of the questions, and the requirement for taking the survey (that you need to be logged in to your main Facebook account).} 
\label{fig:frontpage}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Facebook usage}
Following the first page, is one page about Facebook usage. This page includes questions about sign-up year, how often they check their Facebook page and number of friends. 

\subsection{Facebook privacy: settings}
This is a part of the survey where the users need to be logged in to their main account on Facebook to check how their privacy settings look. The questions are taken directly from the "Privacy"-settings and "Timeline and tagging"-settings on Facebook. We divided these questions onto 4 different pages. Before we started asking about specific settings, we asked the users how often they have checked their Facebook privacy settings during the last year.  One of the following pages ask for the privacy settings, and another for the timeline and tagging settings. These questions are straightforward for the user, since all they have to do is to render the settings they have set themselves. This will easily show us how many that actually have checked their settings, and to what extent they have made them more, or less, private than default. At the end we asked the users whether or not they consider changing their settings after having reviewed them. This can make for some interesting observations, and can also give an impression of whether or not the users care or are aware of the settings. 

\subsection{Facebook privacy: personal experience}

\begin{figure}[h!]

\fbox{
\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{page12.png} }
\caption[Question 21 and 22 in the survey]{\textbf{Question 21 and 22 in the survey.} This figure shows question 21 and 22 in the survey. The questions concerns to what degree (on a scale from 1 to 5) the respondents care about what is published about themselves, and what they publish about others. After each of the two questions it is a text box where the respondents can elaborate.} 
\label{fig:page12}
\end{figure}

This group of questions focus on the users personal experience with concern to both privacy and interdependent privacy. We ask whether or not the respondents have experienced that their use of Facebook has affected their professional life or led to any uncomfortable situations. Both of these questions have a follow-up question where the users are asked to describe the situation that occurred. You will only be sent to the page with the follow-up question if you answered yes. If you answered no, the page with the follow-up question will be skipped. 

A big part of Facebook consists of sharing photos and comments with others, we therefore asked the respondents to indicate on a scale from 1 to 5 how much they care about what is published about themselves, and what they publish about others, see \fref{fig:page12}. It was mandatory for the users to give an answer on the scale. We added a text box for the users to elaborate if desired, but this was not mandatory. We received a total of 250 responses on our survey, and 190 of them chose to elaborate. 

\subsection{Facebook privacy: apps}
This is the part of the survey that concerns interdependent privacy (see section \ref{sec:intpriv}), and also the most important part of our suvey. As mentioned before this is a relatively unknown term, so we wanted to find out whether or not the respondents knew the meaning of interdependent privacy. Since the app platform on Facebook to a high extent relies on information about a user's friends, it is in this area interdependent privacy becomes more important to address. When you install an app on Facebook, it asks for your basic information, and often more information about you and your friends. For more detailed information about the app-platform, see subsection \ref{subsec:app}. Question 26, 27, 28 and 29 (see \fref{fig:page14} and \fref{fig:page15}) asks about the users awareness regarding what kind of information the apps can retrieve. There exists settings directed towards apps on Facebook (see \fref{fig:apps2013}). In question 30 (\fref{fig:page15}) we ask the user to look at one of the app settings, "Apps others use". In this setting the user decides which information they make available to apps others use, in other words control the categories of information that people can bring with them when they use apps. We want to know if the user are aware of the existence of this setting. We did not ask for more specifics about what information they share, because this is not relevant. What is relevant is whether or not they know it exists, and are aware of what kind of information they share. We finish this part of the survey with the same question we started it with, if they know the meaning of interdependent privacy. We wanted to ask again to see if they got a higher understanding of the term after answering questions about apps, and saw how it is all interconnected.

Question 31 asks the respondents whether or not they know what the term interdependent privacy means after answering questions about apps.} 
\label{fig:page15}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Facebook security: settings}
The main focus in this report is on privacy, not security. At the same time, we wanted to ask a few questions regarding Facebook security settings as well. The reason for this is because we wanted to see if there was a connection between strict security settings and strict privacy settings among the respondents of our survey. The questions concerns whether or not the respondents use secure browsing and login notification.

\subsection{Demographics}
In the last part of our survey, we have asked for demographic information about the respondents, to get a hunch of what kind of people have taken the survey. We chose to put the demographics part at the end, rather than in the beginning. We assume that a respondents attention span gets lower during the survey, we therefore wanted to put the "easy" questions at the end since they require less focus. These questions consists of: gender, age, country, family situation, highest qualification/degree, employment status and income. Although these questions are easy to answer, they are very important to include. When analysing, they are necessary in order to be able to draw comparisons between for example age and/or gender. An interesting factor is to see where the respondents using AMT come from.  

\section{Distributing the Survey}
First we created a requester account on AMT. We did this using an already existing Amazon account. While creating the project (our project contained only one HIT) we filled out the properties shown in \fref{fig:amtedit}. First we had to give a short title and description to describe our HIT to the workers. This is the information that is shown to the workers before they choose to either accept the HIT or skip the HIT. We also had to decide a reward for the workers. We had limited time, and wanted our HIT to be as attractive as possible, and therefore chose to have a higher reward than average. We sat the reward to be \$1.5 per completed assignment. We estimated that it would take approximately 15 minutes to take the survey, this would give a hourly wage of \$6. We were also asked to set a maximum number of assignments per HIT, this means number of unique answers. We sat this number to 250. We felt that 250 responses would give us a very good foundation to base our analysis on. AMT defines a feature that let the requester review the answers, and then choose to either approve or discard them. When discarding an answer, they worker will not get paid. If we did not manually approve the answers, they would automatically be approved after 3 days. We made the HIT available for only 21 days. To get a high quality on the responses, we were advised to use "Master Workers". This is users that have a good reputation from previous work done on AMT. See section \ref{sec:methodology} for more information about "Master Workers". 

\begin{figure}[h!]

\caption[Creating an AMT project]{\textbf{Creating an AMT project.} This figure shows the layout for creating a new project in AMT. Here we stated the title, description, keywords, as well as defining the reward, number of unique workers and expiration date on the HIT.} 
\label{fig:amtedit}
\end{figure}

Next we filled in the "Survey-Link"-template provided by AMT, and the result of this is shown in \fref{fig:amtlayout}. It contains a title and a short description. In the description we linked to the homepage of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, to emphasize the seriousness of the survey. In addition it contained the link to the survey on SurveyMonkey, as well as a field for the users to enter a survey code. This code was provided to them after they completed the survey. This was an assurance for us, so we only paid the people who actually took the survey. To avoid workers cheating with the code (for example getting the code from a fellow AMT-worker), we changed it several times during it's lifetime. 

\begin{figure}[h!]

\label{fig:amtlayout}
\end{figure}

After editing the project as described above, the HIT was ready to be published. The published HIT is shown in \fref{fig:hitout}. After filtering on HITs requiring Master qualification, our HIT is shown at the top. 
Once our HIT was out, all we could do was to monitor it (approve or discard answers), and wait for people to respond. 

\begin{figure}[h!]

\fbox{
\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{hitout.png} }
\caption[Our HIT is published]{\textbf{Our HIT is published.} This figure shows our HIT in the list of all HITs available that requires "Master Workers".} 
\label{fig:hitout}
\end{figure}

We mainly wanted to distribute our survey on AMT, both to try it out as a research tool and because of it's high diversity. But in addition to distributing the survey on AMT, we decided to also share it with our friends on Facebook. We wanted to reach out to a even wider audience, as well as making our Facebook  friends aware of their settings. Most of our Facebook friends mainly consist of fellow students, with a high technical knowledge. We were not depending on Facebook to give us many answers. We were hoping for at least 30 respondents from Facebook, but we got 77 respondents and were amazed of the outcome. We posted it and a few times during the 3 weeks the survey was out, we commented on it so it would appear on top of our friends' News Feeds. Three of our friends even chose to share it on their Facebook. This was probably one of the reasons we got so many answers. We posted it on Facebook a few days later than the HIT was published on AMT.  

\begin{figure}[h!]

\fbox{

\end{figure}

\fref{fig:answersamt} and \fref{fig:answersfacebook} shows the daily distribution of number of answers, respectively from AMT and Facebook. You can see from \fref{fig:answersamt} that we had the highest peak in responses the day it was published on AMT. The first day we had 55 unique answers, and the second day it dropped to 13 answers. The number of responses varied during the rest of the period, as the figure shows. 

\section{Feedback on the Survey}
We got a lot of positive feedback on our survey from Facebook friends. Many have liked it, and many have commented on it. The comments focused mainly on the eye opening aspects of the survey and that it was informative. Some said the survey made them have a clean-up of their settings. Some mentioned that they though they had good control over their settings, but after taking the survey they realized that this was not the case. They became aware of something they did not know. Overall, the feedback was very positive. As mentioned above, 3 of our Facebook friends chose to share the survey further, and this suggests that they were pleased with it and thought it was good and informative. 

Our survey has also been mentioned in forums on for example mturkform.com and mturkgrind.com. Most of the comments regarding our survey on these forums are about the time consumed taking the survey. The comments we got from mturkforum was: \textit{"Time 5 min 35 sec - slow b/c I wanted to learn more about FB privacy..."} and \textit{"Took 8 minutes, light writing but very simple."}
The comments from mturkgrind was: \textit{"About 5 minutes"} and \textit{"Took 8 minutes, very simple and probably could do it in less time. Light writing"}
