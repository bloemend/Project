This study was performed as a specialization project on behalf of the Department of Telematics at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. The specialization project is part of two main profiles, information security and tele-economics, and this report is the final result of the project and is worth 15 ECTS points. The study was conducted between September and December 2013. The project description was outlined in cooperation with our project supervisor PhD Gergely Biczók at the Department of Telematics. 

We would like to thank Gergely Biczók who has guided us through our project, and contributed with helpful ideas, feedback and support. We would also like to thank                        everyone who answered our answer, and helped us with valuable research information. A special thanks to our friends Aurora Klæboe Berg, Kine Aasjord Omholt and Thomas Normann for sharing the survey on their Facebook page, and making the survey reach out to a wider audience.  \\
