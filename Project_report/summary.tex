\begin{abstract}
With the evolvement of the online social networks, the incentive to share personal information has grown drastically. Along with the enormous data sharing that exists in todays interconnected world, privacy concerns arise. The privacy of an individual is bound to be affected by the decisions of others, and are therefore to some degree out of the users control. This phenomenon lays the basis for the term \textit{interdependent privacy}. In this study we will direct our focus to Facebook, todays larges online social network.  

Interdependent privacy is one specific part of the privacy issues that exists on Facebook. In order to get a full overview and understanding on this matter, we have looked into different aspects. We have mapped the development of the default privacy settings and the most important features introduced by Facebook over the years, and how these features have affected the users' privacy. We have also looked at human awareness in regard to Facebook privacy, how much they care about their privacy as well as their awareness regarding apps' permission requests.

To map human awareness, we constructed a survey. In order to get a good image of people's awareness we distributed the survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT). This is a marketplace for work that requires human intelligence. One of the key benefits of using AMT is that it provides one of the largest subject pools, with both diversity and low cost. The survey was available on AMT for 3 weeks, and received a total of 250 responses from 13 different countries. We analyzed these results with focus on awareness of privacy settings (including app settings). We wanted to see if there was a connection between privacy settings, and app settings and awareness of the permissions requested when installing apps. 

%Results: What's the answer? Give specific results.
Our results show that all our respondents at some point have changed their privacy settings, as nobody have all their settings set to what is default. The majority of all respondents check their settings 3-6 times a year. When we look at the corner-points, the ones that check them frequently and the ones that have not checked their settings during the last year, we see a clear difference. This gave the basis for two hypotheses that we thoroughly investigated in our report. "The ones that check their Facebook settings seldom do not have as private/secure settings, and do not have as much knowledge about app permission requests as the ones who check their Facebook settings often." and "The ones with many apps have less knowledge about the app permission requests, and less knowledge about the existence of the setting "Apps others use"." 

Our research backs up both hypotheses. A higher percentage of the ones checking frequently have changed their settings to a more private/secure option. Meaning that they are aware of the settings existence. These users were both younger (almost 10 years) and more active (almost 20\% more active), than the ones seldom checks their settings. The ones checking frequently are also to a higher extent aware of the permissions apps request. As well as the setting "Apps others use", which to a high extent regards interdependent privacy. 
We also looked at the awareness of the permission requests for the ones having many and few apps connected to their Facebook. The ones having few apps are more aware of all the requests we have presented in our survey, and this group was also more aware of the existence of the setting "Apps others use", in comparison to the ones having many apps connected to their Facebook. 

An interesting observation was that the respondents of our survey cared more about what they post (comments, photos, etc.) about others, than about what is posted about themselves. The knowledge of the term interdependent privacy, as well as the knowledge about the permissions apps request was low.

%Conclusion: What are the implications of your answer? summary of the discussion of the results and conclusion 
The result from our research shows that our initial assumptions were correct. Especially that there exists little knowledge around the issue regarding interdependent privacy. Online privacy is a hot topic in media and people care about what is posted about them, still they have poor security/privacy settings and low/no knowledge about the app permissions. Are Facebook trying to hide the fact that information about you may be shared without your knowledge, because it is in conflict with their vision of an open and interconnected world?
