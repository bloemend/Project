\section{Default Privacy Settings}\label{sec:first_section}
In this chapter we are going to look into the history of Facebookâ€™s privacy settings, and map the development from 2006 until today. 

\paragraph{}
Facebook has evolved from being a networking site for students attending Harvard to becoming a global phenomenon. Facebook's user interface has gone through several changes over the years, which has brought both joy and frustration to the users. When these changes have been made, there has also been adjustments to the default privacy settings as well \cite{EvoPriv2}. At the beginning, in 2005, when Facebook first was applied outside of Harvard University, the users personal information was only accessible to a users Facebook friends and to people connected to the same network on Facebook \cite{EvoPriv}. 

The changes to the default privacy settings are emphasized in \tref{tab:dps}.
