\section{}
In this section we will describe our approach of collecting data from Facebook users regarding their view on Facebook privacy settings. Facebook is a global social network, so to be able to get more accurate information it is important to reach out to a wide and diverse audience. We decided to use Amazon Mechanical Turk for this purpose. To gather the data, we made a survey for the users to answer. Survey is a common used research method that involves the use of standardized questionnaires or interviews to collect data about people and their preferences, thoughts and behaviours in a systematic manner \cite{survey}. Survey, as a research method, has several distinct advantages in comparison to other methods of doing research. Survey is a good method of retrieving unobservable data, like for example peoples attitudes, behaviours, characteristics, preferences, and demographics.
